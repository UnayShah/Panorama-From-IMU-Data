# ECE 276A: Orientation Mapping and Panorama Creation

## Introduction
This is project 1 of the course [ECE 276A: Sensing & Estimation in Robotics](https://natanaso.github.io/ece276a/) at UCSD, being taught by professor [Nikolay Atanisov](https://natanaso.github.io/).

This project provides IMU, VICON and camera data. Using these, it is required to improve reading of the angular velocity component of IMU data using gradient descent with the linear acceleration as the ground truth. This data can be used to find the orientation of the sensor setup in terms of [Euler angles](https://natanaso.github.io/ece276a/ref/ECE276A_3_Rotations.pdf) which can give the Rotation Matrix of the image. Using the rotation matrices of the images, they can be stitched into a panorama.
